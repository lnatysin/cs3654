    "# Exploring Music Through the Decades\n",
    "### The Tune Trackers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze the top 20 songs from each decade to uncover trends and patterns in music over time. Using Spotify's dataset, we will explore how musical characteristics have evolved across decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "1. What are the common connections between top songs across different decades?\n",
    "2. How similar are the top 20 songs within a decade, and how do they vary between decades?\n",
    "3. How have the dominant themes in popular music evolved over the decades?\n",
    "4. Is there a relationship between musical genres and lyrical content over time?\n",
    "5. How do the top songs of each decade compare in terms of mood or sentiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Sources\n",
    "We plan to split up the work, listening to the top 20 songs for each decade according to these websites.\n",
